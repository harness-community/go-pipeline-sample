# Go Sample Pipelines in Harness

Introduction
========================
This repository is a home for snippets of YAML code and a sample hello world server for the Harness CI Community.

## Getting Started

Use this README to get started with our sample pipeline repository for Go. This guide outlines the basics of getting started with the Harness CI and provides a full code sample for you to try out. This sample doesn’t include configuration options, for in-depth steps and configuring the pipeline for example using triggers or using our templates see the Pipeline Configuration Docs.

The Pipeline will build and run a unit test on a sample go repository, and upload the artifact to Docker Hub. You can use publicly-available code, images, and your GitHub and Docker Hub accounts.

## Workflow
- Build the code and run unit tests.
- Package the app as a Docker image and upload it to Docker Hub.
